        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jocelyn Diego and Im currently a UCR 2nd year student going to be my 3rd year this upcoming fall. UCR was not my dream school or the school I thought I was going to end up at. When i got to this school I came to this school trying to major in psychology but then under the circumstances, I changed my major to liberal studies taking it as a sign. I have always been a student that never saw school as an important thing I just thought it was a waste of time, but after maturing and growing and going into high school. I viewed school way differently. I knew getting good grades and trying my best in every material and trying to take higher classes than basic classes will bring me to the student I am. I took the risk and took honors and ap classes that led me to gain the gpa I needed in order to get accepted to higher rank classes. Getting accepted to more than 10  schools, feeling so proud of myself because I did this with no help and sacrifices that any high school student wouldn‚Äôt. I put all my ‚Äúhigh school enjoyment‚Äù aside and focus in order to have good grades every semester and gain a new GPA or higher. Graduating as a 26 student with high honors, more than 10 school acceptance, and a full ride to some schools. All thanks to me and my effort. Looking at all my acceptance and seeing UCR giving me the opportunity to enter coming from a  low-income family. And just like that, I‚Äôm a UCR student majoring in psychology, but by my second year, I switch my major to liberal studies. It was a change that I had no idea of and never knew I was going to decide this change, and now I still believe that this drastic change is for a reason, and maybe majoring in psychology was not for me, and maybe in another lifetime. 
<br><br>
                  Trying to major in psychology was fun, and learning about the human mind is crazy. At the beginning of my college journey, I work with Behaviors Health. This job was working with Autistic children, I met so many children around my neighborhood and each of them had different personalities and different difficult goals to reach. The team manager and supervisors were super nice and understanding about certain situations.

<br><br>
              After, this change I had to leave and switch work in order to gain more experience in my current major. I‚Äôm currently working on that but I‚Äôve been tutors for younger students before. Becoming a Teacher for future students is my dream because I love helping children and guiding them. Just like I was guided when I started school. I had a wonderful elementary school experience with my teachers who all helped. Especially since I came from a household where English was not spoken and these teachers helped me be the student I am now. Therefore,  trying to major in Liberal Studies and become a 1st/2nd-grade teacher is my dream and something I‚Äôm willing to go for and accomplish.
